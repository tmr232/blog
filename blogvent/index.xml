      <description>I always knew image alt-text existed. I knew about it from learning HTML - it&amp;rsquo;s the text that shows when the image doesn&amp;rsquo;t load. And it&amp;rsquo;s also on XKCD as the extra pun (TIL that&amp;rsquo;s actually title= and not alt=). It&amp;rsquo;s only recently, when Twitter added image descriptions1 and my feed started talking about them, that I realized how important they are for accessibility.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making an effort to describe the images in all my tweets to the best of my ability.</description>

      <description>When I started my professional career I was not doing software engineering, but rather reverse-engineering. Taking a compiled binary, disassembling it, and trying to understand what it does. My job was essentially reading code, with the stated goal in my job description was &amp;ldquo;vulnerability research&amp;rdquo;. Since then, I moved to the other side, and am now doing &amp;ldquo;forward engineering&amp;rdquo;.
While it is very tempting to say that as programmers (or developers, or software engineers, or whichever term you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with) we only write code, we know that this is not true.</description>
