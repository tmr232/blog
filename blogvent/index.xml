      <description>When I started my professional career I was not doing software engineering, but rather reverse-engineering. Taking a compiled binary, disassembling it, and trying to understand what it does. My job was essentially reading code, with the stated goal in my job description was &amp;ldquo;vulnerability research&amp;rdquo;. Since then, I moved to the other side, and am now doing &amp;ldquo;forward engineering&amp;rdquo;.
While it is very tempting to say that as programmers (or developers, or software engineers, or whichever term you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with) we only write code, we know that this is not true.</description>
