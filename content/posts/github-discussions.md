Recently I decided that I want to have comments in my blog.

But... I don't wanna host them.
For various reasons.
From maintenance and moderation to GDPR and the likes.

Instead, I am using GitHub discussions and a bit of hacky Python
to generate discussions for my posts.
It is hosted in a [Github action](https://github.com/tmr232/hugo-discussions-action),
but I really don't recommend using it yet.
It is super ad-hoc and experimental.

But... if all went well, you'll see a link to the discussion below the post!
