So a bit of a last minute decision, but here goes!

Inspired by [Ólafur Waage](https://olafurw.com/)'s [post](https://olafurw.com/2022-11-27-blogvent-calendar/),
I decided to try and follow suit.
After all - I've not blogged for about a year and a half, and that's way too long.

So, blatantly copying Ólafur:

## Rules

* One post every day in December.
* Each post has to be about tech/code in some way.
* Each post has to be longer than 4 tweets. (1120 characters)
* Posts don’t have to be revolutionary (this is a writing exercise, it’s ok to write a basic tutorial about if statements).
* Posts have to be written that day, you can’t stock up.
* Posts can be a continuation of Yesterday’s post (again, this is mainly a writing exercise).
* No edits or people reviewing your drafts (writing exercise, etc)
