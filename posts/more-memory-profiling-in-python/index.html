<h2 id=tldr>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Graph memory-usage over time, correlate with logs, profit.</p>
<h2 id=overconfidence>Overconfidence</h2>
<p>Recently, I had to reduce the memory consumption of a Python process that became entirely unreasonable. Now, a while back I wrote about <a href=https://blog.tamir.dev/posts/finding-a-memory-leak-in-my-python-code>finding memory leaks in Python</a>. I was pleased with myself and sure that with the knowledge I gained then, I can surely get this done!</p>
<p>And oh, was I wrong&mldr;</p>
<h2 id=harsh-reality>Harsh Reality</h2>
<p>You see, both <a href=https://pympler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>pympler</a> and <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html>tracemalloc</a> are wonderful tools. But like all tools, they have limitations. When you have a long-running (days) process with many (hundreds of millions) objects, the memory and performance costs of your tools add up quite significantly. Waiting for <code>pympler</code> to query <em>all objects</em> takes forever, and following references is completely impractical; viewing <code>tracemalloc</code> statistics is nice, but doesn&rsquo;t help you narrow things down enough.</p>
<p>So, after 2 weeks of zero-to-minimal improvements (though I was <em>sure</em> I&rsquo;m on the right track) I decided to try a different approach to understanding the memory usage of my code.</p>
<h2 id=to-the-rescue>To The Rescue</h2>
<p>Enter <a href=https://gist.github.com/tmr232/4a10e17ddf4aefcc0c94a15bdddc58f4>memlog.py</a>.</p>
<p><code>memlog</code> is a simple, naive tool. It tracks the overall memory usage on a machine, and logs it (with a timestamp) to a CSV. That&rsquo;s it. While the recorded data may include significant noise, running your code (& <code>memlog</code>) inside a container can reduce it significantly. Also, background memory noise tends to be insignificant when your process hogging all of your memory&mldr;</p>
<p>So, I ran my process (with logs), ran <code>memlog</code>, and plotted a memory-over-time graph:
<img src=https://blog.tamir.dev/images/more-memory-profiling.png alt="The image shows a graph of memory-usage over time. The graph shows a near-instant 4.5-unit rise at the start, then a slow 2-unit rise over a long time, then a near-instant decline back to 0 at the end."></p>
<p>And oh, oh no.</p>
<h2 id=insight>Insight</h2>
<p>Looking at the graph, we can divide it into 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A near-instant rise at the beginning. This is by far the bulk of the memory-usage increase;</li>
<li>A slow, gradual increase over the entire time-scale;</li>
<li>A near-instant drop in memory-usage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those parts are basically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loading the data-set and various initialization;</li>
<li>The bulk of the processing;</li>
<li>Program termination.</li>
</ol>
<p>And for the past 2 weeks I&rsquo;ve been busy reducing the memory-usage of&mldr; the second part. Being absolutely sure it&rsquo;s the most significant.</p>
<p>So yeah, that hurt. But only for a short time. For you see, with this newfound knowledge I could safely focus on the first few minutes of execution and disregard the rest for the time being.</p>
<p>True. I&rsquo;ll have to test the whole thing once I&rsquo;m make any significant changes. Memory-usage might spike at a later point. Memory-optimization may cause performance degradation. But unless I reduce that uptick at the beginning I won&rsquo;t get any significant improvements.</p>
<h2 id=profit>Profit</h2>
<p>A week later, we managed to reduce memory-usage by 30% while <em>reducing</em> overall processing time by a similar percentage. We had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a de-duplicating weakref based cache;</li>
<li>Add a pre-processing step;</li>
<li>Make our code more cache-friendly by sorting our data;</li>
<li>Remove a massively over-engineered control mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p>But it was all made possible by <em>focusing on the right part</em>. Had I not plotted that memory graph, I could&rsquo;ve easily spent another 2 weeks without any significant progress.</p>
<h1 id=old--wise>Old & Wise</h1>
<p>So whatever you do, I highly suggest you graph your data. No need to be smart about it. Log it, graph it, correlate to your logs.</p>
